# Research Update from Courant Institute

**March 10, 2025**

As I approach the halfway point of my Ph.D. program at NYU's Courant Institute, I wanted to share 
an update on my current research projects and collaborations. This post provides an overview of 
my work at the intersection of generative modeling, physics-based simulations, and video synthesis.

## Current Research Focus

Under the guidance of Prof. Benjamin Peherstorfer, my research has been focused on developing 
novel generative models that can accurately capture and simulate complex physical systems. 
We're particularly interested in applications where traditional numerical solvers are 
computationally prohibitive, such as real-time fluid simulations and interactive design tools.

### Project 1: Neural PDE Solvers

Our first major project involves developing neural network architectures that can efficiently 
approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern fluid dynamics. 
By combining insights from physics with recent advances in generative modeling, we've created 
a framework that can:

- Generate high-resolution fluid simulations up to 100x faster than traditional numerical solvers
- Preserve important physical properties like mass and energy conservation
- Handle complex boundary conditions and geometries
- Generalize to simulation parameters outside the training distribution

Initial results from this work were presented at last month's computational physics workshop, 
and we're currently preparing a manuscript for submission.

### Project 2: Physics-Informed Video Generation

Building on our work with neural PDE solvers, we're now exploring how to incorporate physical 
constraints into video generation models. This project aims to address one of the major limitations 
of current video synthesis approaches: the lack of physical plausibility in generated content.

By incorporating explicit physics-based loss terms and specialized network architectures, 
our models are showing promising results in generating videos with realistic fluid motion, 
object interactions, and natural phenomena.

## Collaborations

One of the most rewarding aspects of working at Courant has been the opportunity to collaborate 
across disciplines. Some of our current collaborative efforts include:

### Climate Science Partnership

We're working with researchers from NYU's Center for Data Science and the Department of Earth Science 
to apply our generative models to climate data. This collaboration aims to develop tools that can 
generate high-resolution climate simulations for various scenarios, potentially accelerating climate 
research and policy planning.

### Computer Graphics Collaboration

We've recently established a partnership with the computer graphics lab to explore applications of our 
physics-informed generative models in creating realistic visual effects for films and games. This 
collaboration bridges the gap between scientific simulation and creative applications.

## Recent Recognition

I'm honored to have received the Harold Grad Memorial Prize this year for contributions to computational 
mathematics. This recognition has been tremendously encouraging and provides additional support for our 
ongoing research efforts.

## Looking Ahead

As I look toward the second half of my Ph.D. program, I'm excited to continue developing these research 
directions. Upcoming milestones include:

- Open-sourcing our neural PDE solver framework this summer
- Submitting our physics-informed video generation work to a major computer vision conference
- Beginning a research internship at Google this May, where I'll work on large-scale generative models
- Developing new courses on generative modeling for computational science applications

I'll continue to share updates and insights from this research journey. If you're working in related areas 
or interested in potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.
