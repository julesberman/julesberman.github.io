      I am currently a Research Analyst at <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a> in New York City where I work under 
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Bgb5TUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dmitri Chklovskii</a> in the Neural Circuts and Algorithms group as part of the Center of Computational Neuroscience.

      I am in my last semester of my M.S. in <a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/masters/ms-gsas/ms-scientific-computing/">Scientific Computing</a> 
      within the Mathematics department at NYU's Courant Institute.

          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02039" class="project-link">Bridging the Gap: Point Clouds for Merging Neurons in Connectomics</a>
          <div>
            This is my current research project conducted at Flatiron Institue. We are currently preparing the paper for submission to MIDL 2022.
            <br />
            <br />
            We propose a novel method based on point cloud representations for merging disjoint neurons across large gaps in EM data. More generally, we aruge for the viability of point cloud based representations in the proofreading of 3D segmentaions generated EM images. This is a first step in using Geometric Deep Learning methods to integrate information about the underlying non-euclidean geometries naturally present in Connectomics data.

              This is a review paper overviewing current methods in the application of Deep Learning method in solving PDEs. We examine Neual Net based stencil approximations, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and various formulations of Neural Operators.

            <div>
              This is a research paper that examines ensemble methods applied to protein embeddings generated from unsupervised protein models. We show that a variety of ensemble methods can meaningfully improve performance on downstream tasks. This indicates that different unsupervised protein models learn complementary representations of proteins.
