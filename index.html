      I am currently a Research Analyst at <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a> in New York City where I work under 
      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Bgb5TUAAAAJ&hl=en">Dmitri Chklovskii</a> in the Neural Circuts and Algorithms group.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am in my last semester of my M.S. in <a href="https://www.math.nyu.edu/dynamic/masters/ms-gsas/ms-scientific-computing/">Scientific Computing</a> 
      within the Mathematics department at NYU's Courant Institute.
      <br />
      <br />
      My recent research projects concern the use Deep Learning methods applied to problems within Neuroscience and more specifically Connectomics.
      One main objective is the processing of electron microscopy images taken of neurons at cellular resolutons.

          <a class="project-link">Point Clouds for Connectomics</a>
          <div>
            This is research conducted at Flatiron Institue. We show the viability of point cloud based representations in the proofreading of 3D segmentaions generated EM images.
            <br /><br />
            This is a first step using Deep Geometric Learning methods to integrate information about the underlying non-euclidian geometries naturally present in connectomics data.

            <div>
              This is a graduate class review paper overviewing current developments and methods in the application of Deep Learning method in the solve of PDEs. We examine Neual Net based stencil approximations, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), and various formulations of Neural Operators.

            <div>
              This is a graduate class research paper which examines ensemble methods applied to protein embeddings generated from unsupervised protein models. We show that a varitey of ensemble methods can meaningfully improve performance on downstream tasks.
